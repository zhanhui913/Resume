We develop an interactive floor system using Microsoft Kinect as the sensor and a projector to project well designed games onto the floor. The objective was to help patients regain movements in their injured legs. We accomplished that by pinpointing the leg biped of the user and have them play our games as a way to exercise different part of their legs. This project was jointly developed in collaboration with the Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital.

I also implemented many of the interactions with objects and aggressors in our levels. I also performed duties of a QA as I was debugging our entire game. I also had to help our programmers, as they were not experienced with coding in Unity.

I improved the business’s competitiveness by suggesting to implement an achievement section to increase compliance with veterinarians and increase the popularity and excitement of the website. It was such a triumph as it became the core component of the website. The client Paul Steier was dazzled by my creativity and wants me to work with him on another project through the summer.
